This is a c++ wrapper for the NIST Statistical Test Suite. See 

http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html

for details. As the NIST suite is public domain so is this wrapper.

Why write a wrapper for the NIST suite?

1. To have each test wrapped in a clean class that can easily be used as a
   component.

2. To get a usable output of the test data in _one_ table which can then be
   processed by the data processing software of choice, e.g. qtiPlot, Origin, 
   etc.

To build just type "make".

To get some help on the available command line options, just execute the
program without any command line option.

Have fun,
Jochen
